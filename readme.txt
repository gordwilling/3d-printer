A project report excerpt describing development of a sub-optimal voxelization algorithm. A clear window into how my brain works when approaching a new problem, being pwned by the problem, facing time constraints, refusing to be beaten, forced to compromise, then having everything work out as it always does. 

Code is not included because it was not reflective of my normal standards. The project was successful, but there were a lot of issues and emergencies on the electronics and mechanical side that required my attention. And there were 10 other classes to work on! 

The project was ambitious & we were laughed at initially. We got it done and posted the highest grade.

Don't tell me I can't do something.

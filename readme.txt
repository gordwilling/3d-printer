In my final year at university for Electrical Engineering, my team of three designed and built a a 3d-printer from scratch. I designed and built the frame and other mechanical bits, researched and procured UV-activated resin samples and the UV light source, wrote the printer firmware (in C), printer driver for windows (in C++), and the UI for selecting, scaling, positioning and voxelizing the model (C++ & Direct3D) in preparation for printing. Another group member did a great job on the the motors and driving circuits, and the third guy had a great sense of humor.

This is a project report excerpt describing development of the voxelization algorithm. The idea was so simple it had to work, but it didn't quite, and I compromised to get something going. We got a high grade and then school was over and I didn't care anymore!
